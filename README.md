# Linked Dictionary

Yet another, but a very simple concept to turn tree data structures into Linked Data based on plain key-value dictionaries. That's it.

Goals:
 * simplicity
 * unambiguity
 * processing speed
 * language, serialization format, agnostic

Linked dictionary is not a JSON-LD alternative. JSON-LD provides a full feature set to transform general JSON into/from RDF. Linked dictionary intentionally provides only basics, a simple mapping, and can serve only to a limited subset of JSON-LD use-cases.
